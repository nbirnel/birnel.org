I was unemployed for nearly three months. 
I did almost no scripting. 
Back at work, I needed to code up something on the quick,
so I reached for perl.

Mistake!
Turns out you really do have to use perl at least once a week
to remember all of its insane rules. 
It took me all morning to write thirty lines of simple stuff.

Ruby looks better and better, 
no matter how slow it is,
and how gee-wiz the community can be.
