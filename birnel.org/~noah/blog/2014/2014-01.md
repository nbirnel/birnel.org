I was unemployed for nearly three months. 
I did almost no scripting. 
Back at work, I needed to code up something on the quick,
so I reached for perl.

Mistake!
Turns out you really do have to use perl at least once a week
to remember all of its insane rules. 
It took me all morning to write thirty lines of simple stuff.

Ruby looks better and better, 
no matter how slow it is,
and how gee-wiz the community can be.

"Don't overthink it."

I heard this today. I usually feel like it means the opposite of what the words
say.

I think it usually means: "Think long and hard about what is going on, and then
guess what the answer is, because I am not going to tell you, even if you ask."
