2013-11-18 Korg MS-20 patches, and how to count them
------------
How many different patches are available on the Korg MS-20 synthesizer, and
how can they be organized, cataloged, and compared?

I have been recording my patches,
and developing a vim syntax file to make this recording 
easier.<sup><a href=#fn1 id=ref1>1</a></sup>
The going is harder than I had thought it would be,
and I started to wonder if there is a way to automate it further.
Here are some of my intitial thoughts.

There are 15 inputs on the MS-20, and 20 outputs. So there are:

    P(20,15) = 20·19·18·17·16·15·14·13·12·11·10·9·8·7·6 = 20,274,183,401,472,000

possible combinations using all inputs. That is more than I want to compute or
store. So let's back off and try something simpler. How many single cord
patches are available?

    15 inputs · 20 outputs = 300 patches

Now some of these are meaningless; such as patching the Trigger Out directly
into the Trigger In. We will cull these out manually before continuing. Others
are meaningless as they stand, but we assume may become more interesting as we
add more patches; such as patching White Noise into the Sample & Hold In
without using the Sample & Hold Out. We will perhaps mark these somehow to
represent 'pointless on their own, but holding promise in combination.'

So, we generate our single-cord patches by brute force in perl - two arrays of
patch-points, and:

    foreach $output (@outs) {
        foreach $input (@ins) {
            printf("%s -> %s\n", $output, $input);
        }
    }

Then we edit, looking for the two types of exceptions.

    #!/bin/sed -f

    s/-> S&H-clock-in$/& #S\&H-in #S\&H-out/
    s/-> S&H-in$/& #S\&H-clock-in #S\&H-out/
    s/^S&H-out.*/& #S\&H-clock-in #S\&H-in/

    s/-> VCA-CV-in$/& #VCA-in #VCA-out/
    s/-> VCA-in$/& #VCA-CV-in #VCA-out/
    s/^VCA-out.*/& #VCA-CV-in #VCA-in/

    /KBD-trig-out -> Trig-in/d
    /KBD-CV-out -> VCO1+2-CV-in/d

(We will assume that using any of the External Signal Processor outs implies
that we have plugged something external into the ESP In.)

This still leaves us with 298 'cooked' patches. I had been hoping to cull it
to under 256, thus leaving us with a byte per patch, but no such luck. There
are 196 that are conceivably meaningful as they stand, and 102 that could be
meaningful with two additional patches.

So let us number each one of these patches. The order does not matter, but
each single-cord patch must have a unique, unambiguous number. We will also
add patch number 0 to represent 'no patches'. Every possible patch combination
will include patch 0.

    sed '1iNo-patches' single-patches-cooked | nl -v0 -nln

Now, we can build arrays for each patch combination we wish to examine. Once
we have arrays, we can compare any two - do they have the same elements? Which
elements are missing? 

This does not protect us from impossible patches, however. For instance, the
patch:

    MG-triangle-out -> VCHPF-cutoff-in
    MG-pulse-out -> VCHPF-cutoff-in

can't exist. If we only need to compare two patches that we know exist, this
is fine. But if we ever want to sanity-check our patches, we will be stuck.

Let's try this: We will represent each patch combination as an array of
numbers. We can then compare the arrays to eachother in various ways.  The
numbers will then represent individual cables in another data structure: an
array of two-element arrays of 'source' and 'destination'. If we wish to see
if a given patch is possible, we will gather the destinations of each cable in
the patch array, and check that they are unique, and ditto for the sources.

OK, I have an idea for a data structure. Coding will wait for another day.
