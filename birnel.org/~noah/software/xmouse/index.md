Yet another X mouse emulator for Windows.
Select to copy, middle-click to paste.
You know the drill; or if you don't, you probably don't want this.

To run:
<a href="./xmouse.zip">Download</a>,
unzip,
put it someplace, 
and double-click it.

Source is available at <a href="http://www.github.com/nbirnel/xmouse.git">github</a>

I think I probably pulled most of this from a forum post somewhere.
