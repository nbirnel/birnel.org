This nuts-and-bolts guide provides all the necessary  information for planning a network, getting the necessary components, and  understanding protocols that you need to design and implement your network.  The wireless Internet infrastructure, also known as Wi-Fi, is based on the  802.11b standard.</p><p>The book covers Rob's experience with the Sebastopol Community Network  (NoCAT), a multi-tiered network that provides wireless access for O'Reilly  employees and free Web browsing to anyone in the area who has a Wi-Fi card  in his or her computer.

A lot of organizations are not only attracted to VoIP's promise of cost savings, but its ability to move data, images, and voice traffic over the same connection. Think of it: a single Internet phone call can take information sharing to a whole new level.</p><p> That's why many IT administrators and developers are actively looking to set up VoIP-based private telephone switching systems within the enterprise. The efficiency that network users can reach with it is almost mind-boggling. And cheap, if the system is built with open source software like Asterisk. There are commercial VoIP options out there, but many are expensive systems running old, complicated code on obsolete hardware. Asterisk runs on Linux and can interoperate with almost all standards-based telephony equipment. And you can program it to your liking.</p><p> Asterisk's flexibility comes at a price, however: it's not a simple system to learn, and the documentation is lacking.  <i>Asterisk: The Future of Telephony</i> solves that problem by offering a complete roadmap for installing, configuring, and integrating Asterisk with existing phone systems. Our guide walks you through a basic dial plan step by step, and gives you enough working knowledge to set up a simple but complete system.</p><p> What you end up with is largely up to you. Asterisk embraces the concept of standards-compliance, but also gives you freedom to choose how to implement your system. <i>Asterisk: The Future of Telephony</i> outlines all the options, and shows you how to set up voicemail services, call conferencing, interactive voice response, call waiting, caller ID, and more. You'll also learn how Asterisk merges voice and data traffic seamlessly across disparate networks. And you won't need additional hardware.  For interconnection with digital and analog telephone equipment, Asterisk supports a number of hardware devices.</p><p> Ready for the future of telephony? We'll help you hook it up.</p></div>","Technology & Engineering / Telecommunications","2012-12-07 01:50:36","0","0000-00-00","2012-12-22 02:40:53","b0def9971a1d07847e278598238426fb",

Raskin explains why today's interface techniques lead straight to a dead end, and offers breakthrough ideas for building systems users will understand -- and love. Raskin reveals the fundamental design failures at the root of the problems so many users experience; shows how to understand user interfaces scientifically and quantitatively; and introduces fundamental principles that should underlie any next-generation user interface. He introduces practical techniques designers can use to improve their productivity of any product with an information-oriented human-machine interface, from personal computers to Internet appliances and beyond.

This book is funny, but it is also an important wake-up call for software companies that want to reduce the size of their customer support bills. If you were ever stuck for an answer to the question, ???Why do good programmers make such awful software???? this book holds the answer.???<br>???<i>John McCormick, Locksmith columnist, TechRepublic.com</i> </blockquote> <blockquote>???I must say first, I don???t get many computing manuscripts that make me laugh out loud.

You know that from personal experience, whether you use computers for work or personal tasks.

You???ll slap your thigh with the same hand that so often pounded your computer desk and wished it was a bad programmer???s face. But Dave hasn???t written this book just for laughs.

How long before you won???t be able to tell if you are texting a person or an especially ingenious chatterbot program designed to simulate intelligent human conversation? <br><br>According to Richard Dooling in <i>Rapture for the Geeks</i>???maybe not that long. It took humans millions of years to develop opposable thumbs (which we now use to build computers), but computers go from megabytes to gigabytes in five years; from the invention of the PC to the Internet in less than fifteen. At the accelerating rate of technological development, AI should surpass IQ in the next seven to thirty-seven years (depending on who you ask). We are sluggish biological sorcerers, but we???ve managed to create whiz-bang machines that are evolving much faster than we are.<br> <br>In this fascinating, entertaining, and illuminating book, Dooling looks at what some of the greatest minds have to say about our role in a future in which technology rapidly leaves us in the dust. As Dooling writes, comparing human evolution to technological evolution is ???worse than apples and oranges: It???s appliances versus orangutans.??? Is the era of Singularity, when machines outthink humans, almost upon us? Will we be enslaved by our supercomputer overlords, as many a sci-fi writer has wondered? Or will humans live lives of leisure with computers doing all the heavy lifting? <br><br>With antic wit, fearless prescience, and common sense, Dooling provocatively examines nothing less than what it means to be human in what he playfully calls the age of b.s. (before Singularity)???and what life will be like when we are no longer alone with Mother Nature at Darwin???s card table. Are computers thinking and feeling if they can mimic human speech and emotions? Does processing capability equal consciousness? What happens to our quaint beliefs about God when we???re all worshipping technology? What if the human compulsion to create ever more capable machines ultimately leads to our own extinction? Will human ingenuity and faith ultimately prevail over our technological obsessions? Dooling hopes so, and his cautionary glimpses into the future are the best medicine to restore our humanity.","Computers / Social Aspects / General","2012-12-07 02:19:43","0","0000-00-00","2012-12-31 04:26:42","01f5e57a2a7733cde5f8b8dd21b53dda",

Written by Irma Starkloff Rombauer, a St. Louisan, it was first tested and illustrated by her daughter, Marion Rombauer Becker, and subsequently it was revised and enlarged through Marion's efforts and those of her architect husband, John W. Becker. Their sons -- Ethan, with his Cordon Bleu and camping experiences, and Mark, with his interest in natural foods-have reinforced <I>Joy</I> in many ways. <P> Now over forty, <I>Joy</I> continues to be a family affair, demonstrating more than ever the awareness we all share in the growing preciousness of food. Special features in this edition are the chapter on <I>Heat,</I> which gives you many hints on maintaining the nutrients in the food you are cooking, and <I>Know Your Ingredients,</I> which reveals vital characteristics of the materials you commonly combine, telling how and why they react as they do; how to measure them; when feasible, how to substitute one for another; as well as amounts to buy. Wherever possible, information also appears at the point of use. <P> Divided into three parts, <I>Foods We Eat, Foods We Heat</I> and <I>Foods We Keep,</I> <I>Joy</I> now contains more than 4500 recipes, many hundreds of them new to this edition -- the first full revision in twelve years. All the enduring favorites will still be found. In the chapter on <I>Brunch, Lunch and Supper Dishes</I> there are also interesting suggestions for using convenience and leftover foods. Through its more than 1000 practical, delightful drawings by Ginnie Hofmann and Ikki Matsumoto, <I>Joy</I> shows how to present food correctly and charmingly, from the simplest to the most formal service; how to prepare ingredients with classic tools and techniques; and how to preserve safely the results of your canning and freezing. <P> <I>Joy</I> grows with the times; it has a full roster of American and foreign dishes: Strudel, Zabaglione, Rijsttafel, Couscous, among many others. All the classic terms you find on menus, such as Provencale, bonne femme, meuni??re and Florentine, are not merely defined but fully explained so you yourself can confect the dish they characterize. Throughout the book the whys and wherefores of the directions are given, with special emphasis on that vital cooking factor -- heat. Did you know that even the temperature of an ingredient can make or mar your best-laid plans? Learn exactly what the results of <I>simmering, blanching, roasting</I> and <I>braising</I> have on your efforts. Read the enlarged discussion on herbs, spices and seasonings, and note that their use is included in suitable amounts in the recipes. No detail necessary to your success in cooking has been omitted. <P> <I>Joy</I>, we hope, will always remain essentially a family affair, as well as an enterprise in which its authors owe no obligation to anyone but to themselves and to you. Choose from our offerings what suits your person, your way of life, your pleasure -- and join us in the <I>Joy</I> of cooking. <P> Because of the infinite patience that has gone into the preparation of <I>Joy of Cooking,</I> the publishers offer it on a money-back guarantee.

All recipes are based on readily available ingredients and have been scrupulously adapted for American kitchens. The recipes are enlivened by the author's anecdotes and personal reminiscences of her years in India, including stories of gathering recipes from royal families and temple cooks, which had been jealously guarded for centuries. The American-born Devi, who as the disciple and personal cook of an Indian spiritual leader spent eight years off and on travelling with him in India and elsewhere, has assembled about 500 detailed, carefully written recipes representing the vast range of Indian cooking styles. They provide excellent, workable versions of--among much else--Indian pancakes, flitters, dumplings, breads, cheese and yogurt dishes, and sweets and pastries. (American vegetarians should note that the recipes use no eggs.) Only a real hater of Indian flavors could fail to come away with ideas almost begging to be adopted in everyday use--say, spicy creamed spinach. There are attractive experiments with American ingredients like maple syrup and jicama as well as the dozens that must be sought in Indian stores.

Cooking could no longer remain a private passion for Irma. She had recently been widowed and needed to find a way to support her family. Irma was a celebrated St. Louis hostess who sensed that she was not alone in her need for a no-nonsense, practical resource in the kitchen. So, mustering what assets she had, she self-published <I>The Joy of Cooking: A Compilation of Reliable Recipes with a Casual Culinary Chat.</I> Out of these unlikely circumstances was born the most authoritative cookbook in America, the book your grandmother and mother probably learned to cook from. To date it has sold more than 15 million copies. <P> This is a perfect facsimile of that original 1931 edition. It is your chance to see where it all began. These pages amply reveal why <I>The Joy of Cooking</I> has become a legacy of learning and pleasure for generations of users. Irma's sensible, fearless approach to cooking and her reassuring voice offer both novice and experienced cooks everything they need to produce a crackling crust on roasts and bake the perfect cake. All the old classics are here -- Chicken a la King, Molded Cranberry Nut Salad, and Charlotte Russe to name a few -- but so are dozens of unexpected recipes such as Risotto and Roasted Spanish Onions, dishes that seem right at home on our tables today. <P> Whether she's discussing the colorful personality of her cook Marguerite, whose Cheese Custard Pie was not to be missed, or asserting that the average woman's breakfast was ""probably fruit, dry toast, and a beverage"" while the average man's was ""fruit, cereal, eggs with ham or bacon, hot bread, and a beverage,"" the distinctive era in which Irma lived comes through loud and clear in every line. Enter a time when such dishes as Shrimp Wiggle and Cottage Pudding routinely appeared on tables across America. <P> The book is illustrated with the silhouette cutouts created by Irma's daughter Marion, who eventually wrote later editions of <I>The Joy of Cooking.</I> Marion also created the cover art depicting St. Martha of Bethany, the patron saint of cooking, slaying the dragon of kitchen drudgery. This special facsimile edition contains both Irma's original introduction and a completely new foreword by her son Edgar Rombauer, whose vivid memories bring Irma's kitchen alive for us all today.","Cooking / General","2012-12-07 02:57:28","0","0000-00-00","2012-12-22 02:41:47","3ba75d59a59be0523c4b886ab86a01b6",

Fifty years later, the American-style lager beer they invented was the nation???s most popular beverage??and brewing was the nation???s fifth-largest industry, ruled over by titans Frederick Pabst and Adolphus Busch.

From setting up automated build environments to managing 20,000 Exchange email clients in an organization, any tool that reduces the number of repetitive steps an administrator must perform, is a real win. Even better, PowerShell part of a major Microsoft initiative that aims to replace a host of Windows management tools with a single, unified shell. This is the promise of PowerShell and the reason IT professionals need to start learning how to use it today  Reflecting the best of legacy tools such as bash and the Korn shell, PowerShell also breaks new ground in its command language design and its use of the object-oriented .NET Framework. And there is no better way to learn how to put PowerShell to work than to get your hands on Monad, O'Reilly's innovative, hands-on introduction to the tool. This concise 200-page book is an exciting tour of some of the new capabilities that PowerShell puts into the hands of system administrators and power users, and is the perfect complement to existing PowerShell documentation.  With more than 40 hands-on activities, the book covers every angle, from using PowerShell commands and its object-oriented pipelines to querying systems, generating reports and writing scripts that automate existing tasks. Adding to the lure is the fact that the book is written by Microsoft manager, Andy Oakley with a Foreword by PowerShell architect Jeffrey Snover-so you can be certain that it's teeming with inside information. Monad lets you see for yourself how PowerShell can significantly improve your productivity.  Because the PowerShell technology has wide appeal, so, too, does this compact guide. Developers, administrators, and power users alike can all benefit from its insight. If you're someone who habitually drifts toward the c-m-d keys, knows all of the switches to most command tools, or spends time authoring batch files to solve new challenges, this book is right up your alley. And if your organization plans to upgrade soon to Exchange 2007 or MOM V3, there's no time to waste.

It sets the stage for an array of case-study volumes, each of which focuses on a single area of the world. Each case study uses the contemporary musical situation as a point of departure, covering historical information and traditions as they relate to the present.

The website also includes instructional materials to accompany each study. <br>     <em>Music in Bulgaria</em> presents a focused introduction to the rich and varied tradition of Bulgarian music. Taking readers on a tour of the country's musical landscape, it explores ways in which Bulgaria's rural traditions affect the expression and interpretation of its music and examines how Bulgaria's history has influenced its music over many decades. The book also shows how musical traditions have been preserved and have flourished despite the social changes brought about by the post-WWII era of industrialization, modernization, and urbanization. Timothy Rice demonstrates how Bulgarian music--in addition to being an art and an entertainment--is deeply embedded in the cultural, social, economic, and political life of the country. He analyzes how this music has spread to other cultures and how it has made its mark on new forms of popular music.

It sets the stage for an array of case-study volumes, each of which focuses on a single area of the world. Each case study uses the contemporary musical situation as a point of departure, covering historical information and traditions as they relate to the present. Visit www.oup.com/us/globalmusic for a list of case studies in the Global Music Series. The website also includes instructional materials to accompany each study. <br>     <em>Music in Ireland</em> provides an engaging and focused introduction to Irish traditional music--types of singing, instrumental music, and dance that reflect the social values and political messages central to Irish identity. This music thrives today not only in Ireland but also in areas throughout North America, Europe, Australia, and Asia. <br>     Vividly evoking Irish sounds, instruments, and dance steps, <em>Music in Ireland</em> provides a springboard for the discussion of cultural and historical issues of identity, community, nationalism, emigration, transmission, and gender. Using the informal instrumental and singing session as a focal point, Dorothea E. Hast and Stanley Scott take readers into contemporary performance environments and explore many facets of the tradition, from the ""craic"" (good-natured fun) to performance style, repertoire, and instrumentation. Incorporating first-person accounts of performances and interviews with performers and folklorists, the authors emphasize the significant roles that people play in music-making and illuminate national and international musical trends. They also address commercialism, globalization, and cross-cultural collaboration, issues that have become increasingly important as more Irish artists enter the global marketplace through recordings, tours, and large-scale productions like <em>Riverdance</em>. <br>     Packaged with a 70-minute CD containing examples of the music discussed in the book, <em>Music in Ireland</em> features guided listening and hands-on activities that allow readers to gain experience in Irish culture by becoming active participants in the music.","Social Science / Anthropology / Cultural","2012-12-21 02:42:18","0","0000-00-00","2012-12-22 02:43:37","2562d6cd0bfa3c907c02610b96af6428",

With skill and eloquence, Gregory brings the age vividly to life, as he relates the exploits of missionaries, martyrs, kings and queens including the quarrelling sons of Lothar I, and the ruthless Queen Fredegund, third wife of Chilperic. Portraying an age of staggering cruelty and rapid change, this is a powerful depiction of the turbulent progression of faith at a time of political and social chaos.","Literary Collections / Essays","2012-12-21 03:01:11","0","0000-00-00","2012-12-22 02:43:59","789b5c0fb3835f8a72cf284ce803e5d6",

Carroll originally created the dream adventures to amuse Alice Liddell, his young neighbor, and the riddles, puns, parodies, and absurd arguments about meanings and manners brilliantly mock -- and undermine -- the rules and social conventions adults invariably impose on children. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865) and Through the Looking-Glass (1872) have also always attracted and intrigued older, more sophisticated readers. From the critic William Epsom's ground-breaking Freudian interpretation of the books to Virginia Woolf's declaration that ""the two Alices are not books for children, they are the only books in which we become children"", to countless studies by philosophers, linguists, mathematicians, and literary critics, it has long been acknowledged that Carroll's masterpieces redefined our notions of ""children's literature"". In the Introduction, Hugh Haughton chronicles the genesis of the Alice books and frankly discusses Carroll's infatuation with Alice Liddell and his life-long fascination with preadolescent girls, the subject of much speculation during Carroll's lifetime and ever after.","Fiction / Literary","2012-12-21 03:04:21","0","0000-00-00","2012-12-22 02:44:11","0b92e276130fe4e49c4f318b745ae7a7",

His sheer escapism and joy is balanced by Tu Fu, who expresses the Confucian virtues of humanity and humility in more autobiographical works that are imbued with great compassion and earthy reality, and shot through with humour. Together these two poets of the T'ang dynasty complement each other so well that they often came to be spoken of as one - Li-Tu' - who covers the whole spectrum of human life, experience and feeling.","Poetry / Asian / General","2012-12-21 03:08:13","0","0000-00-00","2012-12-22 02:44:17","8b047377f2400a04e8a56c2a8c7ca17e",

Erec and Enide explores a knight's conflict between love and honour, Cliges exalts the possibility of pure love outside marriage, while the haunting The Story of the Grail chronicles the legendary quest.

Malcolm examines the different religious and ethnic inhabitants of Bosnia, a land of vast cultural upheaval where the empires of Rome, Charlemagne, the Ottomans, and the Austro-Hungarians overlapped. Clarifying the various myths that have clouded the modern understanding of Bosnia's past, Malcolm brings to light the true causes of the country's destruction. This expanded edition of Bosnia includes a new epilogue by the author examining the failed Vance-Owen peace plan, the tenuous resolution of the Dayton Accords, and the efforts of the United Nations to keep the uneasy peace.</p> <p>What went wrong in the country where Christians and Muslims mingled and tolerated each other for over five centuries? It was a land with a vibrant political and cultural history, unlike any other in Europe, where great powers and religions-the empires of Rome, Charlemagne, the Ottomans; the faiths of Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, Judaism, and Islam overlapped and combined. In this first English-language history of Bosnia, Noel Malcolm provides a narrative chronicle of the country from its beginnings to its tragic end. Clarifying the various myths that have clouded the modern understanding of Bosnia's past, Malcolm brings to light the true causes of the country's destruction: the political strategy of the Serbian leadership, the conflict between the city and the countryside, the fatal inaction and miscalculations of Western politicians. Putting the Bosnia war into perspective, this volume celebrates the complex history of a country whose past, as well as its future, has been all but erased.

My original preference as a title was the more cumbersome but more accurate 'Anarchism As A Theory Of Organization' because, as I urge in my preface, that is what the book is about. It is not about strategies for revolution and it is not involved in speculation on the way an anarchist society would function.

Where other writers in this genre have generally shielded themselves from letting things get too bad or go too far, Lewis comes face-to-face with the unimaginable.

Lewis is a brilliant observer of human nature and has a read on her employers and coworkers that lends unique insight into the seedy underground of the more hardcore sex industry. Lewis is a sex worker by choice. She neither condemns nor condones the work, though she depicts her experiences with a gallows humor that reveals the complexity of professional adult sex work. <i>Indecent</i> offers readers an insider's account of hard-earned lessons and acute insight gained from over a decade in the trenches of one of America's most insidious and lucrative industries.<BR></div>","Social Science / Prostitution & Sex Trade","2012-12-21 03:54:13","0","0000-00-00","2012-12-22 02:45:22","42d1ab4612fe5383c6d62feeb7772558",

Perhaps because feet and footwear have held such an important position in so many cultures, ""Heavenly Soles"" reveals the changing position of women in the 20th century - the first era in which it has been fashionable for them to walk, freely and comfortably, and in which shoes have been designed for fit and balance. Despite the inevitable decline in craftsmanship and the general trend towards practicality, this book shows that extravagant fancy has continued to thrive in the work of such wildly imaginative 20th-century designers as Vivier, Ferragamo, Perugia, Charles Jourdan, Manolo Blahnik and Maud Frizon, as well as other important but until now largely overlooked designers. Organized as an historical survey of the finest European and American shoe design, the text is illustrated with new photography and historical black-and-whites, and concludes with a newly updated international compendium of the best of late-20th-century designers.","Social Science / Customs & Traditions","2012-12-22 02:21:23","0","0000-00-00","2012-12-22 02:45:40","60ab701e8a0c4cd592fd75cb8992472f",

All projects are illustrated with photographs and measured drawings. Included here are plans for tool chests, workbenches, lathes, and historical reproductions of items for the home: a six-board chest, rustic chairs with cattail seats, a churn for the kitchen, and the Rittenhouse hygrometer. Roy also explores building barns, forges, boats, and even colonial fortresses.    A wonderful feature of this book is Roy's own translation of the humorous fifteenth-century poem <i>The Debate of the Carpenter's Tools</i>. He also provides a fascinating and useful 'field guide' to American tool marks that shows how to identify the specific tool used by the marks it left.

What are the implications, beyond the simple dictionary definitions, of using words such as <em>privilege, hysteria, seminal,</em> and <em>gyp?</em> <p> Browsing through the pages of <em>The Barhart Concise Dictionary of Etymology</em> is like exploring the historical, political, and rhetorical wonderland of our linguistic heritage. We see the evolution of ideas, as rootword connections that now seem arbitrary are traced to schools of thought from the past. We also find an opportunity to examine how the sometimes backwards, sometimes hilarious, and sometimes illuminating ideologies built into our language affect our modern thinking. <p> Written in a fresh, accessible style, this book provides the derivations of over 21,000 English-language words without resorting to the use of abbreviations, symbols, or technical terminology. Drawing on the most current American scholarship, and focusing on the core words in contemporary English, <em>The Barnhart Concise Dictionary of Etymology</em> is both a diverting browse and a thinking person's Bible.","Reference / Dictionaries","2012-12-22 19:46:50","0","0000-00-00","2012-12-22 19:46:52","e6b6cb99ea1d017bb0af731dea133d34",

The Knight of the Cart is the first telling of the adulterous relationship between Lancelot and Arthur's Queen Guinevere, and in The Knight with the Lion Yvain neglects his bride in his quest for greater glory. Erec and Enide explores a knight's conflict between love and honour, Cliges exalts the possibility of pure love outside marriage, while the haunting The Story of the Grail chronicles the legendary quest. Rich in symbolism, these evocative tales combine closely observed detail with fantastic adventure to create a compelling world that profoundly influenced Malory, and are the basis of the Arthurian legends we know today.","Poetry / Ancient, Classical & Medieval","2012-12-22 23:35:00","0","0000-00-00","2012-12-22 23:35:01","ce12a6cfdc06cb31d796c01094347779",

To ask why is to ask why fire burns. His credo may be stated thus: he has sworn an oath to keep his mushroom patches secret and to find and to poach on the patches of other hunters. When mushrooms are the prize, the scope of all his aspirations is narrowed to these two goals. Though in all else he may be as Saintly as St. Francis, in the pursuit of these ends he is more Satanic than Satan.

The author, William Clark Russell, was one of the nineteenth-century's most popular and prolific writers of nautical literature, and his short stories and novels were so widely read that they were mentioned in other novels of the day. Largely forgotten today is the fact that Russell brought his prodigious storytelling talents to bear upon the true-life exploits of Admiral Lord Nelson. In 1890 Russell published a dense and lengthy biography of the admiral that left no stone unturned about the naval hero's life. With the timelessness of a good novel, the much leaner and better-paced Pictures focuses solely on the action-filled episodes of the Nelson saga. Modern-day readers who revel in the works of Patrick O'Brian and C.S. Forester will find it to be just as enjoyable as did Russell's contemporaries.","History / Military / Naval","2012-12-29 06:32:33","0","0000-00-00","2012-12-29 06:33:16","bf4529702c852a7d9e2eeb65749b91d6",

Bounded on the east by the crest of the Cascade Range and on the west by the lofty east flank of the Olympic Mountains, Puget Sound terrain includes every imaginable topographic variety. This thoughtful and eloquent natural history of the Puget Sound region begins with a discussion of how the ice ages and vulcanism shaped the land and then examines the natural attributes of the region - flora and fauna, climate, special habitats, life histories of key organisms - as they pertain to the functioning ecosystem. Mankind's effects upon the natural environment are a pervasive theme of the book. Kruckeberg looks at both positive and negative aspects of human interaction with nature in the Puget basin. By probing the interconnectedness of all natural aspects of one region, Kruckeberg illustrates ecological principles at work and gives us a basis for wise decision-making. ""The Natural History of Puget Sound Country"" is a comprehensive reference, invaluable for all citizens of the Northwest, as well as for conservationists, biologists, foresters, fisheries and wildlife personnel, urban planners, and environmental consultants everywhere. Lavishly illustrated with over three hundred photographs and drawings, it is much more than a beautiful book. It is a guide to our future. Arthur Kruckeberg, a Northwest naturalist for forty years, is professor emeritus of botany at the University of Washington.","Nature / Regional","2012-12-30 00:32:08","0","0000-00-00","2012-12-30 00:32:11","71600b504ad0939e807bbe559c8425b9",

Previously anyone interested in identifying and learning about the fauna and flora has had to consult a different book for each life form: a tree book for the Pacific yew, a wildflower guide for Indian pipe, and some other reference for garter snakes. In this guidebook, Eugene Kozloff has compiled a general natural history of the region, including about 450 species of plants and animals. In order to be as thorough as possible and still preserve the portability of the book, the author has included those species that are fairly common, widely distributed, and can be easily identified by nonspecialists. This book is substantially complete for trees, shrubs, vines, major wildflowers, ferns and fern allies, and amphibians and reptiles. A few especially abundant or conspicuous mammals are discussed, and there are helpful suggestions for beginning the study of birds of the region. Also included is a wide selection of mosses, liverworts, and lichens, as well as the more common snails, slugs, millipedes, centipedes, and certain other invertebrates.","Nature / Regional","2012-12-30 00:32:46","0","0000-00-00","2012-12-30 00:32:48","2a9a04a1caed4cb8fba4a0474af7efff",

Although in the agricultural mind, the agricultural revolution is often seen as a one-step transition from hunter-gatherer societies to farming ones, Smith shows how truly varied the patterns of animal and plant domestication were in different parts of the world.","Technology & Engineering / Agriculture / General","2012-12-30 00:34:56","0","0000-00-00","2012-12-30 00:35:31","febcc0f71f902be8e958a0485cebc79f",

Upon its publication, the book began to transform attitudes about society and religion, and was soon used to justify the philosophies of communists, socialists, capitalists, and even Germany's National Socialists.

She was warm in every wind and weather, but he was always cold. His hands were as cold as his smile, and almost as cold as his heart. He wore gloves when he was asleep, and he wore gloves when he was awake, which made it difficult for him to pick up pins or coins or the kernels of nuts, or to tear the wings from nightingales.</i><br><br>So begins James Thurber???s sublimely revamped fairy tale, <i>The 13 Clocks</i>, in which a wicked Duke who imagines  he has killed time, and the Duke???s beautiful niece, for whom time seems to have run  out, both meet their match, courtesy of an enterprising and very handsome prince in disguise. Readers young and old will take pleasure in this tale of love forestalled but ultimately fulfilled, admiring its  upstanding hero (???He yearned to find in a far land the princess of his dreams, singing as he went, and possibly slaying a dragon here and there???) and unapologetic villain (???We all have flaws,??? the Duke said. ???Mine is being wicked???), while wondering at  the enigmatic Golux, the mysterious stranger whose unpredictable interventions speed the story to its necessarily happy end.","Juvenile Fiction / Fairy Tales & Folklore / General","2012-12-31 04:21:32","0","0000-00-00","2012-12-31 04:21:34","12fb337b6ffcb3c8575b738ceecf7a90",

There is Whit Diffie, the long-haired Newton of crypto who invented the astounding ""public key""solution; David Chaum, whose ""anony-mous digital money""actually threatened the global financial infrastructure; and ""cypherpunks""like Phil Zimmermann, who freely distributed military-strength codes under the nose of the U.

There is also the first behind-the-scenes account of what the secretive National Security Agency really had in mind when it created the controversial ""clipper chip""-and how the Clinton administration bungled the operation.<br><br>Cryptography-the use of secret codes-has traditionally been the province of puzzle geeks and government spies.

By 1993, the computer industry had changed so rapidly the company was on its way to losing $16 billion and IBM was on a watch list for extinction -- victimized by its own lumbering size, an insular corporate culture, and the PC era IBM had itself helped invent.</p><p>Then Lou Gerstner was brought in to run IBM. Almost everyone watching the rapid demise of this American icon presumed Gerstner had joined IBM to preside over its continued dissolution into a confederation of autonomous business units. This strategy, well underway when he arrived, would have effectively eliminated the corporation that had invented many of the industry's most important technologies.</p><p>Instead, Gerstner took hold of the company and demanded the managers work together to re-establish IBM's mission as a customer-focused provider of computing solutions. Moving ahead of his critics, Gerstner made the hold decision to keep the company together, slash prices on his core product to keep the company competitive, and almost defiantly announced, ""The last thing IBM needs right now is a vision.""</p><p><em>Who Says Elephants Can't Dance?</em> tells the story of IBM's competitive and cultural transformation. In his own words, Gerstner offers a blow-by-blow account of his arrival at the company and his campaign to rebuild the leadership team and give the workforce a renewed sense of purpose. In the process, Gerstner defined a strategy for the computing giant and remade the ossified culture bred by the company's own success.</p><p>The first-hand story of an extraordinary turnaround, a unique case study in managing a crisis, and a thoughtful reflection on the computer industry and the principles of leadership, <em>Who Says Elephants Can't Dance?</em> sums up Lou Gerstner's historic business achievement. Taking readers deep into the world of IBM's CEO, Gerstner recounts the high-level meetings and explains the pressure-filled, no-turning-back decisions that had to be made. He also offers his hard-won conclusions about the essence of what makes a great company run.</p><p>In the history of modern business, many companies have gone from being industry leaders to the verge of extinction. Through the heroic efforts of a new management team, some of those companies have even succeeded in resuscitating themselves and living on in the shadow of their former stature. But only one company has been at the pinnacle of an industry, fallen to near collapse, and then, beyond anyone's expectations, returned to set the agenda. That company is IBM.</p><p>Lou Gerstener, Jr., served as chairman and chief executive officer of IBM from April 1993 to March 2002, when he retired as CEO. He remained chairman of the board through the end of 2002. Before joining IBM, Mr. Gerstner served for four years as chairman and CEO of RJR Nabisco, Inc. This was preceded by an eleven-year career at the American Express Company, where he was president of the parent company and chairman and CEO of its largest subsidiary. Prior to that, Mr. Gerstner was a director of the management consulting firm of McKinsey & Co., Inc. He received a bachelor's degree in engineering from Dartmouth College and an MBA from Harvard Business School.</p>","Business & Economics / General","2013-04-26 04:21:34","0","0000-00-00","2013-04-26 04:21:47","d343749628af809786c2dadae236e924",
